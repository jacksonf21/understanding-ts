***TSC CONFIG SETTINGS (inside tsconfig.json)***

include <== same logic as above, you MUST include every file you would like to compile

target <== what type of es ts compiles to, can set es5 es6 etc.

lib <== allows ts to recognize objects such as DOM, console.log(), etc. 

  --LIKELY TO USE COMMANDS--

  ***NOEMITONERROR***
