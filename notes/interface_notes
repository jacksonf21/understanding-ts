***INTERFACES (type)*** 
enforces how an object should look like 

used typically with classes

by enforcing structures, you can enforce methods and or attributes as well, this is useful when a user is extending a new class, and you have logic which relies upon expecting certain methods from these new classes.

prefix - readonly
enforces attributes to only be readable

ie)
interface Greetable {
  readonly name: string;
  greet(phrase: string): void;
}

  ***EXTENDS***
